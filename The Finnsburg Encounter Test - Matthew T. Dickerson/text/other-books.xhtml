            <h3>The Finnsburg Saga</h3>
            <p class="other-books">Inspired by the literary tale surviving in <em>Beowulf</em> as a tragic poem about Finn, Hildeburh, and the fight at Finnsburg, as well as by real historical characters, events, and settings at a particular moment in early medieval Europe, this pair of novels imagines the story of Finn, Hildeburh, and their offspring in the years leading up to, and then following, the famous battle that spawned the poem in <em>Beowulf</em>. It is a tale of epic, heroic romance set in the early and mid 7th Century, bringing readers not only to medieval Friesland but also France and Denmark: to Germanic mead halls and intimidate Merovingian palaces, to rustic monasteries in the Vosges mountains, and to Danish villages in the dead of a long winter. We meet kings and chieftains, warriors and jewelers, bards and monks and fishermen. These are tales of both romance and war, and hope and of loss, and of a timeless question of finding one’s place in the world.</p>

              <p class="other-books"><img class="book_cover" alt="The Finnsburg Encounter by Matthew Dickerson" src="../images/cover.jpeg"/>In the midst of growing powers that threaten his people stands Finn, the Prince of Friesland. Marriage to a beautiful Danish Princess, and the coming of a simple monk, Willimond form the backdrop to this striking novel. The author beautifully recreates a lost time and the terrible events leading to the Battle of Finnsburg. Here faith and heroism mingle in a world between legend and history.</p>

Traveling with his old mentor Willimond, a monk originally of Lindisfarne, Kristinge’s journey brings him first across France to Denmark to search for his mother, and eventually back to his native soil of Friesland. Along the way he meets the young, decadent, and half-crazy Frankish king Clovis who resides in Paris, and the holy Abbess Telchild of the nearby monastery of Jouarre‍—‌two of several historical figures woven through the novel. Kristinge wrestles with the question: who is he, and who should he become? Is he the monk he has spent the past six years training to be? Or the gifted bard that was trained as a youth to compose songs, sing, and play the harp? Or is he the future king that will unite Friesland and save it from the threat of the increasingly powerful Danes and Vikings on the one side and decaying but still threatening Frankish empire on the other. Compounding his confusion, Kristinge also rediscovers and falls in love with a young woman whom he had known many years earlier as a child: a woman who would be far above his station were he to remain a monk but not above his station were he to become king.</p>

            <h3>The Daegmon War Series (in The Chronicles of Gondisle)</h3>
            <p class="other-books">The centuries-old war against the Daegmon Lord has been dormant for generations. Knowledge of the Gifts‍—‌mystical powers of healing, shaping, and knowledge, of speech with creatures, and of supernatural strength in battle‍—‌has faded into dim folklore. So has knowledge of the ancient enemy. When a Daegmon suddenly appears out of the old tales, and begins to wreak destruction on the remote villages of Gondisle, the realm is thrown into turmoil.</p>
            <p class="other-books">The Daegmon War is a three-volume fantasy novel beginning with <em><strong>The Gifted</strong></em>, continuing with <em><strong>The Betrayed</strong></em>, and ending with <em><strong>Illengond</strong></em>.</p>

But they are few, and only a handful of them number among the Gifted. When their own king and his armies turn against them, all seems lost for the company.</p>

But their situation grows more dire when the king not only refuses to give them aid, but proves to be under the influence of the Daegmon Lord’s servants.</p>
              <p class="other-books">In Book 2, Elynna and her companions continue pursuing the Daegmon in a desperate attempt to rescue the realm of Gondisle. The discovery of an old talisman offers a promise of power, and with it a new source of hope, but it also causes dissension within the company. Thimeon abandons the quest, choosing to return alone to the archives of Citadel in hopes of discovering some new knowledge that will aid them in the battle. While Elynna, now bereft of her Andani guide and hunter, must find a way to escape the armies of Citadel without giving up pursuit of the Daegmon. A wild chase leads Elynna and her company across the Plains and into the Undeani highlands where they find new allies, but also encounter new foes and betrayals, and discover that the Daegmon Lord is more powerful than they had ever imagined.</p>

The hope of the land rests on a small group of heroes who possess mystical powers of healing, shaping, knowledge, speech with creatures, and supernatural strength in battle. Yet the combined strengths and gifts of these heroes seem woefully inadequate, while the enemy grows more powerful each day.</p>
              <p class="other-books">In the third volume of this series of epic high fantasy, Tienna, Elynna and their companions, after suffering a devastating defeat, flee east across the wild and rugged Undeani highlands, while Thimeon and Prince Dhan and their small band race north with two treasures from the troves of Citadel: a weapon of power, and an ancient tome of wisdom. Yet Daegmons and the armies of Citadel pursue both companies, whose desperate quests to escape and reunite lead them straight toward Illengond, the ancient holy mountain of the All-Maker. To survive, Tienna must learn what it means to be a healer, Elynna must become a leader, Thimeon must understand ancient wisdom, and all must cling to courage and hope in the midst of loss.</p>

Fly-fishing narratives and fragments of memoir provide the narrative arc for exploring relationships between humans and rivers, and the ways in which our attitudes and philosophies impact our practices and the waters we depend on for life. The authors guide their readers on a journey from Maine’s Androscoggin watershed‍—‌once one of the ten filthiest rivers in the United States and now home to some of the best wild brook trout fishing in the United States‍—‌southward through Kentucky into Tennessee and North Carolina, where a native southern strain of brook trout struggles to survive. Like the rivers themselves, the chapters alternate between flowing narratives and the stiller waters that settle out above dams. While each stone in this mosaic is worth a close look in its own right, seen from a distance the book offers a broader picture of the cold mountain waters of Appalachia and their famous native fish: the brook trout.</p>

He seeks (and guides his readers toward) a deeper understanding of the ecological and cultural significance of this native Rocky Mountains species known as cutthroat trout, and also a greater appreciation of their beauty and value.</p>

Along the way we will fall in love with arctic streams, glacial rivers flowing green with flour, alpine brooks tumbling out of melting snow, and little estuaries where lobsters and brook trout swim within a few yards of each other; with wide deep lakes, little mountain tarns with crystal clear water, and tannin-laden beaver ponds the color of tea. The narratives are creative, personal, and compelling, yet informed by science and history as well as close observation and the eye of a naturalist. The characters in the stories are fascinating, from fly fishing guides to fisheries biologists to wranglers to Dickerson himself who often explores the rivers with a fly rod in hand, but whose writing transcends any sort of fishing narrative. But the most important characters are the rivers themselves whose stories Dickerson tells, and whose music he helps us to hear.</p>

R. R. Tolkien by Matthew Dickerson and Jonathan Evans" src="../images/cover_ents-Elves-and-Eriador.jpg"/></a><em>The Hobbit</em>, <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, and <em>The Silmarillion</em> are rarely considered to be works of environmental literature or mentioned together with such authors as John Muir, Rachel Carson, or Aldo Leopold. Nonetheless, Tolkien’s vision of nature is as passionate and has had as profound an influence on his readers as that of many contemporary environmental writers. The burgeoning field of agrarianism provides new insights into Tolkien’s view of the natural world and environmental responsibility. In <em>Ents, Elves, and Eriador</em>, Matthew Dickerson and Jonathan Evans show how Tolkien anticipated some of the tenets of modern environmentalism in the imagined world of Middle-earth and the races with which it is peopled.</p>
          <p class="other-books">Dickerson and Evans examine Tolkien’s major works as well as his lesser-known stories and essays, comparing his writing to that of the most important naturalists of the past century. A vital contribution to environmental literature and an essential addition to Tolkien scholarship, <em>Ents, Elves, and Eriador</em> offers both Tolkien fans and environmentalists an understanding of Middle-earth that has profound implications for environmental stewardship in the present and the future of our own world.</p>

Lewis by Matthew Dickerson and David O’Hara" src="../images/cover_narnia-and-the-fields-of-arbol.jpg"/></a>In <em>Narnia and the Fields of Arbol: The Environmental Vision of C. S. Lewis</em>, authors Matthew Dickerson and David O’Hara illuminate an important yet overlooked aspect of the author’s visionary work. They go beyond traditional theological discussions of Lewis’s writing to investigate themes of sustainability, stewardship of natural resources, and humanity’s relationship to wilderness. The authors examine the environmental and ecological underpinnings of Lewis’s work by exploring his best-known works of fantasy, including the seven books of the Chronicles of Narnia and the three novels collectively referred to as the Space Trilogy. Taken together, these works reveal Lewis’s enduring environmental concerns, and Dickerson and O’Hara offer a new understanding of his pioneering style of fiction.</p>
          <p class="other-books"><em>Narnia and the Fields of Arbol</em>, the first book-length work on the subject, finds the author’s legacy to have as much in common with the agrarian environmentalism of Wendell Berry as it does with the fantasy of J. R. R. Tolkien. In an era of increasing concern about deforestation, climate change, and other environmental issues, Lewis’s work remains as pertinent as ever. The widespread adaption of his work in film lends credence to the author’s staying power as an influential voice in both fantastical fiction and environmental literature. With <em>Narnia and the Fields of Arbol</em>, Dickerson and O’Hara have written a timely work of scholarship that offers a fresh perspective on one of the most celebrated authors in literary history.</p>

          <p class="other-books">While the success of J. R. R. Tolkien’s <em>Lord of the Rings</em> is remarkable, it’s certainly no mystery. In a culture where truth is relative and morality is viewed as “old-fashioned,” we eagerly welcome the message of these tales: we have free will, our choices matter, and truth can be known. Matthew Dickerson investigates the importance of free will and moral choices in Tolkien’s Middle Earth, where moral victory, rather than military success, is the “real” story. He explores Christian themes throughout, including salvation, grace, and judgment. Following Gandalf will delight veteran Tolkien fans and offer new fans an impressive introduction to his major works. Engaging and theologically thought-provoking, it will interest pastors, students, seminarians, and layreaders.</p>
          <p class="other-books">This book is out of print, but is available as a new, revised, and expended version titled <em>A Hobbit Journey: Discovering the Enchantment of J. R. R. Tolkien’s Middle-earth</em>.</p>

Are we approaching the so-called “Singularity” when human consciousness can (and will) be downloaded into computers? Or is there more to the human person‍—‌something that might be known as soul or spirit? As this book makes clear, the answers to these questions have profound implications to topics such as heroism, creativity, ecology, and the possibility of reason and science. In exploring this important topic, Dickerson engages the ideas of some well-known twentieth- and twenty-first-century espousers of physicalism, including philosopher Daniel Dennett (<em>Consciousness Explained</em>), biologist Richard Dawkins (<em>The God Delusion</em>), futurist-engineer Raymond Kurzweil (<em>The Age of Spiritual Machines</em>), psychologist B. F. Skinner (<em>Beyond Freedom and Dignity</em>), and mathematician-philosopher Bertrand Russell (<em>Why I Am Not a Christian</em>). Through a careful reading of their works, Dickerson not only provides a five-fold critique of physicalism, but also offers a Christian alternative in the form of “integrative dualism,” which affirms the existence of both a physical and spiritual reality without diminishing the goodness or importance of either, and acknowledges that humans are spiritual as well as bodily persons.</p>

          <p class="other-books"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Disciple-Making-Culture-Power-Comfort-ebook/dp/B08B8QB2WV/?tag=matthewdickerson-20"><img class="book_cover" alt="Disciple Making in a Culture of Power, Comfort, and Fear by Matthew Dickerson" src="../images/cover_disciple-making.jpeg"/></a>Speaking in and to a culture that worships power and comfort while cultivating fear as a manipulative tool, Matthew Dickerson offers a transformative alternative: authentic discipleship and disciple making. What does it mean to live as disciples of Christ, what would it look like to be transformed by the Holy Spirit, and how can we be open to that transformation? How can a follower of Christ live as salt and light in the midst of a power-hungry fear-mongering society? And how can we both teach and model that disciple life as we obey Christ’s command to make disciples? In the tradition of spiritual theology and formation, <em>Disciple Making in a Culture of Power, Comfort, and Fear</em> draws deeply from Paul’s Second Epistle to Timothy‍—‌viewed as a reflection on Jesus’ great disciple-making commission‍—‌as well as on Dickerson’s own experiences in disciple-making ministry on college campuses and his local church. Dickerson’s writing is deeply informed by Scriptures, by the works of such important Christian thinkers, theologians, and writers as Eugene Peterson, John Stott, and Richard Foster, and also by the literature of C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien whose works he has been teaching and writing about for more than thirty years.</p>
