    <p class="body"><img style="float: right; padding: 5px; width: 30%; height: auto; display: block;" alt="Matthew Dickerson from the neck up." src="images/matthew-dickerson.jpg"/>Matthew Dickerson’s first novel, a work of medieval historic fiction titled <em>The Finnsburg Encounter</em>, was published in 1991, and later picked up for publication in German translation as <em>Licht über Friesland</em>. The work was based on Dickerson’s study and translation of Old English poetry while a graduate student at  Cornell University, where he also studied (and co-taught his first class on) the writings of J. R. R. Tolkien.</p>
    <p class="body">Matthew eventually earned a PhD in Computer Science with a minor in Old English Language and Literature, and continued to write fiction. A dozen years passed, however, before he published his next two books: a biography of the late singer-songwriter Mark Heard (<em>Hammers and Nails: the Life and Music of Mark Heard</em>) and a study of the theological and moral aspects of Tolkien’s writings (<em>Following Gandalf: Epic Battles and Moral Victory in the Lord of the Rings</em>). The latter of those was a finalist for the year’s Mythopoeic Society award for best work of scholarship, and led to a number of books exploring various aspects of fantasy and mythopoeic literature including <em>Ents, Elves, and Eriador: The Environmental Vision of J. R. R. Tolkien</em> (with Jonathan Evans), <em>From Homer to Harry Potter: A Handbook on Myth and Fantasy</em> (with David O’Hara), and <em>Narnia and the Fields of Arbol: the Environmental Vision of C. S. Lewis</em> (also with David O’Hara).</p>
    <p class="body">Dickerson’s interest in narrative non-fiction nature and environmental writing also grew during that period, with a particular appreciation for the works of Wendell Berry. He also accepted a very modest side gig with a local newspaper writing an outdoors column every other week‍—‌a column which has continued for more than two decades since then and eventually won him the New England Newspaper and Press Association (NENPA) award for best sports column of the year. His interest in nature and environmental writing provided the focus of two of his previously mentioned books on Tolkien and Lewis as well as numerous published essays and book chapters. It also eventually led him to devote more time to creative narrative non-fiction interweaving nature, environmental and outdoor writing. His essays and stories have appeared in many journals such as <em>Written River</em>, <em>Books and Culture</em>, <em>The Other Journal</em>, and <em>Christian History Magazine</em> as well as in several fly fishing magazines including print publications such as <em>The Drake</em>, <em>Eastern Fly Fishing</em>, <em>Northwest Fly Fishing</em>, <em>American Fly Fishing</em>, and <em>Backcountry Journal</em>, and online publications include <em>Fly Fishing International</em> (ffimagazine.com) and the new defunct <em>New England Outdoors and DIY Fishing</em>.</p>
    <p class="body">In 2012, Matthew Dickerson and his friend and co-author of two previous books, David O’Hara, were awarded the Spring Creek Project Environmental Nonfiction Writing Residence at Oregon State University’s Cabin at Shotpouch Creek. During that residency, they completed their first book-length collaborative collection of creative non-fiction titled <em>Downstream: Reflections on Brook Trout, Fly Fishing, and the Waters of Appalachia</em> (2014). The residency also led indirectly to a series called <em>Heartstreams</em> with a different publisher (Wings Press of San Antonio) and three published titles: <em>Trout in the Desert: on Fly Fishing, Human Habits, and the Cold Waters of the Arid Southwest</em> (2015), <em>A Tale of Three Rivers: of Wooly Buggers, Bowling Balls, Cigarette Butts and the Future of Appalachian Brook Trout</em> (2018), and <em>A Fine-Spotted Trout on Corral Creek: On the Cutthroat Competition of Native Trout in the Northern Rockies (2021)</em>.</p>
    <p class="body">A few years after the Spring Creek residency, Dickerson was selected by Glacier National Park as their June, 2017 Artist-in-Residence at and by Acadia National Park as a May, 2018 Artist-in-Residence. Those residencies, along with multiple writing trips to The Farm Lodge in Alaska led to the publication of <em>The Voices of Rivers: Reflections on Places Wild and Almost Wild</em> (2019) as well as <em>A Fine-Spotted Trout on Corral Creek</em> and another forthcoming book in the <em>Heartstreams</em> series about Alaska.</p>  
    <p class="body">In the midst of all his narrative non-fiction, Matthew never lost his love for fiction, including medieval historical fiction as well as fantasy literature. In 2014, Wings Press published his medieval historical novel <em>The Rood and the Torc: The Song of Kristinge, Son of Finn</em> (a sequel to his earlier novel <em>The Finnsburg Encounter</em>). And in 2015, AMG published <em>The Gifted</em>, the first in his three-volume novel titled the <em>Daegmon War</em>. Drastic changes at the publisher led to Dickerson’s decision to take over publishing control of the series and self-publish the second and third volumes: <em>The Betrayed</em> and <em>Illengond</em>.</p>
    <p class="body">He has also published works of spiritual theology (<em>Disciple Making in a Culture of Power, Comfort and Fear</em>) and philosophy of mind, computing, and religion (<em>The Mind and the Machine: what it Means to be Human and Why it Matters</em>)</p>
    <p class="body">Matthew Dickerson is a member of the Chrysostom Society, and the Outdoor Writers Association of America (OWAA) where he is active on the education committee. He teaches at Middlebury College (Vermont) where he spent 10+ years directing (and many more years teaching at or on the steering committee for) the New England Young Writers’ Conference at Breadloaf.  He is currently working on two projects: a collection of essays about trout and rivers in Alaska and a new work of fantasy fiction.</p>
